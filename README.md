# Snotty (WIP)
snotty is a weak and statically typed, compiled language. And yes, it gets compiled to, not machine code, but brainfuck++

This might very well be the first language which has no sign of statement termination, no semicolons, no newlines, nothing.

Here is a small hello world program:
```
ezout 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '\n'
```

# Installation
Its not done yet, please wait for the release. You can check out the stuff left [here](todo.md)

# How to use
Documentation can be found [here](docs/tableofcontents.md)

# Credits
ezlang was inspired by several languages, including [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language). The Documentation style was inspired by the docs of [Samarium](https://github.com/samarium-lang/Samarium/).
Thanks to Me for developing such a wonderful language.
