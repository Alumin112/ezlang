# ezlang
ezlang is a strong and statically typed, compiled language. And yes, it gets compiled to, not machine code, but brainfuck

This might very well be the first language which has no sign of statement termination, no semicolons, no newlines, nothing.

Here is a small hello world program:
```
ezout 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '\n'
```

# Installation and Usage

# Credits
ezlang was inspired by several languages, including [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)
Thanks to Me for developing such a wonderful language.
